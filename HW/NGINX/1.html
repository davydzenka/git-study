NGINX Log Severity Levels
NGINX supports a wide range of severity levels to make it easy to log the information you care about. Each of these levels can be used with the error_log directive to set the minimum level at which messages are logged. Here are the supported levels in lowest to highest order, along with a guide on how they’re used:

Debug – Debugging messages that are not useful most of the time.
Info – Informational messages that might be good to know.
Notice – Something normal but significant happened and it should be noted.
Warn – Something unexpected happened, however it’s not a cause for concern.
Error – Something failed.
Crit – A critical condition occurred.
Alert – Immediate action is required.
Emerg – The system is unusable.
